# Question 3
# Create a boolean patient series indicating whether the date of each patient's earliest diabetes
# diagnosis was between 1st April 2023 and 31st March 2024. If the patient does not have a

# Create a boolean patient series identifying patients who have been diagnosed with diabetes for

# Question 8
# A patient may have mild, moderate and severe frailty codes in their record. A patient's frailty
# is considered to be their most recent frailty code. So if their most recent frailty code was for
# mild frailty, then we would say they have mild frailty.
# Create a boolean patient series indicating whether a patient has moderate or severe frailty, i.e
# where the patient's last record of severity is moderate or severe. If the patient does not have
# a record of frailty, the value in this series should be False.
